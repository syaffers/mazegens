# Playing around with maze generators

Yeah, that's it pretty much.

## Getting started

Compile `mazegen_corner.cpp` as follows:

    g++ -std=c++11 -Wall mazegen_corner.cpp -o mazegen_corner

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with gcc 5.4.0.

## Generating mazes

For python files:

    python <filename>.py

For compiled C++ files:

    ./<compiled_filename>
